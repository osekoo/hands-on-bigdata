**Lab Session: Algorithms and Programming with Spark RDDs in Colab**  

This lab session introduces you to foundational concepts of distributed data processing using Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). You'll leverage Python and the PySpark library within the Colab environment to build, execute, and analyze various Spark programs. The session covers:

- **Setting up PySpark in Colab**: Learn to configure and initialize the SparkContext.
- **Practical Exercises**:
  1. **Word Count Problem**: Implement a Spark algorithm to analyze word frequencies in a text file.
  2. **Data Aggregation**: Compute the average quantities from a sample dataset while minimizing shuffle operations.
  3. **Join Operations**: Explore algorithms to perform equi-joins and right-outer joins on RDDs without the direct `join()` transformation.
  4. **SQL Query Encoding in Spark**: Encode and test SQL-like queries using Python MapReduce transformations.

Each exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of Spark's capabilities, RDD transformations, and actions. You'll also develop skills in optimizing performance and implementing complex operations.

**Tools Required**:
- **Python**: For Spark programming.
- **Colab Notebook**: To run your Spark scripts.

By the end of this session, you'll have hands-on experience in using Spark for solving real-world problems effectively.
